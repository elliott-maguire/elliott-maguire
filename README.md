### Hi there, I'm Elliott ðŸ‘‹

#### I'm a 3rd year undergraduate computer science student at Eastern Washington University, and a junior infrastructure developer in the revenue operations department at SmartRecruiters, Inc.

### Projects

At SmartRecruiters:
- Smartian Space (closed source), a network of microservices & SPAs build with DRF and React, respectively
- Cirrus (closed source), a revamp of the Smartian Space model, but using Go and some new patterns
- Saleshouse (closed source), a web tool for tracking Salesforce report change histories

At IEEE EWU:
- A low-density low-quantity drone swarm experiment with Crazyflie quadcopters and USC's Crazyswarm library

At home:
- Ledger (open source), linear atomic change tracking for flat datasets

### Interests

I enjoy doing infrastructure development (APIs and libraries), but I've recently been diving deep into embedded systems and lower-level things. I started messing around with an Arduino Uno but am now trying to get an STM32F103C8 to do things, hopefully for standard use within the IEEE chapter at my university.

### Practices

- Web development (APIs and SPAs)
- Library and infrastructure development, primarily in automative services and data tooling

### Stack

I work with/can work with Go, C/C++, Python, Node, Dart, Java, HTML/CSS/JS.
