### Hi there, I'm Elliott ðŸ‘‹

#### I'm a 3rd year undergraduate computer science student at Eastern Washington University, and a junior infrastructure developer in the revenue operations department at SmartRecruiters, Inc.

### Projects

- Smartian Space (closed source), a network of microservices & PWAs build with DRF and React, respectively
- Cirrus (closed source), an architecture of many small containerized Go services running from a few DO Droplets
- Brickhouse (open source), a lightweight data warehousing toolkit written in Go
- Saleshouse (open source), a warehousing tool for Salesforce reports that uses Brickhouse

### Interests

I've recently been getting interested in embedded systems as my interest in web development begins to wane, so in my free time I'm messing around with an Arduino and an MSP432 to learn, but professionally I'm working on high-efficiency, low-overhead data warehousing solutions, primarily for the CRM domain.

### Practices

- Web development, primarily in microservices and progressive web applications
- Library and infrastructure development, primarily in automative services and data tooling

### Stack

I work with/can work with Python, Go, C/C++, Node, Dart, Java, HTML/CSS/JS.
