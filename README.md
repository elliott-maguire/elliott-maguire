### Hi there, I'm Elliott ðŸ‘‹

- Junior infrastructure developer for global operations at SmartRecruiters
- API developer at Muriel Finance
- Senior undergraduate computer science student at Eastern Washington University
- Webmaster and drone research lead at IEEE EWU

### Active Projects

**At SmartRecruiters:**
- Hiring Success Business Assessment, a long and complex survey tool used to help customers and prospects evaluate their key hiring metrics. Features some clever abstractions and implementations that make it highly flexible and modular, while retaining important structures necessary for the cohesion of the survey experience.
- Customer Support Portal, a simple app that enables SmartRecruit platform admins to access and interact with all of their open support cases.
- SmartReport/Candidate Experience Evaluator, a tool for evaluating candidate experiences. New build includes a browser extension with a wealth of automatic functionality that makes the SDR's job way easier.
- Saleshouse, a web tool for tracking Salesforce report change histories (uses the Ledger library)

**At Muriel:**
- The Go API that powers the platform

**At Eastern Washington University:**
- A whole bunch of random course projects in C and Java

**At IEEE EWU:**
- A website for the EagleAdapt project
- A small-scale drone swarm orchestration project

### Interests

It's difficult to define specific interests beyond what is presently in front of me. Had I the time, I'd like to think I'd dream up lofty interests to occupy my time and direct my efforts, but as I have work, school, and side projects to focus on, therein my efforts are directed. I enjoy working on the back end of things, writing elegant, concise, high-performance code, and quite honestly disdain working with visual interfaces. I prefer languages like C/C++ and Go over others like Python and JavaScript as I'm fond of typing and imperative constructs. Automating repetitive processes is a priority in most that I do, but in general, I'm interested in making processes run fast and clean.

### Practices

- Web development
- Library and infrastructure development

### Stack

I work with/can work with Go, C/C++, Python, Node, Java, HTML/CSS/JS.
