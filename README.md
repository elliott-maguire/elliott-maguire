### Interests

It's difficult to define specific interests beyond what is presently in front of me. Had I the time, I'd like to think I'd dream up lofty interests to occupy my time and direct my efforts, but as I have work, school, and side projects to focus on, therein my efforts are directed. I enjoy working on the back end of things, writing elegant, concise, high-performance code, and quite honestly disdain working with visual interfaces. I prefer languages like C/C++ and Go over others like Python and JavaScript as I'm fond of typing and imperative constructs. Automating repetitive processes is a priority in most that I do, but in general, I'm interested in making processes run fast and clean.

### Practices

- Web development
- Library and infrastructure development

### Stack

I work with/can work with Go, C/C++, Python, Node, Java, HTML/CSS/JS.
