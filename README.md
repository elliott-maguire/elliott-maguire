### Hi there, I'm Elliott ðŸ‘‹

#### I'm a 3rd year undergraduate computer science student at Eastern Washington University, and a junior infrastructure developer in the revenue operations department at SmartRecruiters, Inc.

### Projects

- Smartian Space (closed-source), a network of microservices & PWAs build with DRF and React, respectively
- Syllogi (open-source), a lightweight data warehousing toolkit written in Go
- Skopi (open-source soon), an AI-powered analytics and insights toolchain

### Research

My primary research focus right now is high-efficiency, low-overhead data warehousing methods. I've been trying to design Syllogi to be a neatly abstract baseline for broader warehousing endeavors, so that I have something I can experiment with when it comes to massive data sets and higher numbers of concurrent synchronizations and such.

### Practices

- Web development, primarily in microservices and progressive web applications
- Library and infrastructure development, primarily in automative services and web-reliant data collection tooling
- Command-line development, primarily in data aggregation and management tooling

### Stack

I work with/can work with Python, Go, C/C++, Node, Dart, Java, HTML/CSS/JS.
