### Hi there, I'm Elliott ðŸ‘‹

#### I'm a 3rd year undergraduate computer science student at Eastern Washington University, and a junior infrastructure developer in the revenue operations department at SmartRecruiters, Inc. I am also the webmaster for the IEEE chapter at my university, and a volunteer youth minister at my church.

### Projects

At SmartRecruiters:
- Smartian Space, a network of microservices & SPAs build with DRF and React, respectively
- Cirrus, a revamp of the Smartian Space model and its implementations, but using Go and some new patterns
- Saleshouse, a web tool for tracking Salesforce report change histories

At IEEE EWU:
- A low-density small-scale drone swarm experiment with Crazyflie quadcopters and USC's Crazyswarm library

At home:
- Ledger, an experiment in efficient linear atomic change tracking for flat datasets

### Interests

Infrastructure development is enjoyable, but recently I've been more interested in embedded systems development and other low-level applications. Though time is severely limited considering commitments, I've tinkered with an Arduino and STM32 (F103C8T6) and enjoyed working with C/C++. I've also worked with some assembly in a course, but beyond that, my knowledge is still limited and I hope to learn more over the next couple years.

### Practices

- Web development (APIs and SPAs)
- Library and infrastructure development, primarily in automative services and data tooling

### Stack

I work with/can work with Go, C/C++, Python, Node, Dart, Java, HTML/CSS/JS.
