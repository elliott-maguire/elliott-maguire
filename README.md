### Hi there, I'm Elliott ðŸ‘‹

#### I'm a 3rd year undergraduate computer science student at Eastern Washington University, and a junior infrastructure developer in the revenue operations department at SmartRecruiters, Inc.

### Projects

- Smartian Space (closed source), a network of microservices & SPAs build with DRF and React, respectively
- Cirrus (closed source), an architecture of many small containerized Go services running from a few DO Droplets
- Ledger (open source), linear atomic change tracking for flat datasets
- Saleshouse (open source), a web tool for tracking Salesforce report change histories

### Interests

I enjoy doing infrastructure development (APIs and libraries), but I've recently been diving deep into embedded systems. I started messing around with an Arduino Uno but am now trying to get an STM32F103C8 to do things, hopefully for standard use within the IEEE chapter at my university.

### Practices

- Web development (APIs and SPAs)
- Library and infrastructure development, primarily in automative services and data tooling

### Stack

I work with/can work with Go, C/C++, Python, Node, Dart, Java, HTML/CSS/JS.
